# What is the Biomass-By-Age Output Extension?

This extension summarizes and maps biomass data by species age classes.  This is particularly useful when it's important to understand how biomass is changing by age-class.  For example, how much aboveground biomass is there for all young pines?  For all oaks older than maturity?  For all old-growth (> 80 year) Doug-fir?
